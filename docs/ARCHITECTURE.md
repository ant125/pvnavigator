# PVNavigator – Architecture Canon

## Philosophy

PVNavigator is a modular photovoltaic tool platform.

Core principles:

- Free tools must remain truly free.
- Physics and economy must be separated.
- UI and math must be separated.
- Single Source of Truth for calculations.
- No hidden selling logic in free tools.

## Monorepo Structure

├── apps/
│   ├── pvnavigator-web/        # Public portal / hub (marketing + routing only)
│   ├── speicher-physik/        # Free – 1 year physical model
│   ├── speicher-wirtschaft/    # 15 years economy + performance
│   └── pvshadow/               # Geometry / shading analysis

│   ├── pv-core/                # Pure physics & battery math

│   └── bdew-profile/           # Load profiles (8760h)

## Rules

1. All math lives ONLY in packages/*
2. apps/* contain:
   - UI
   - server actions (orchestration only)
   - validation
3. No calculation logic inside apps/*
4. 8760 hours is canonical year model
5. No duplicated formulas across apps

## Product Separation

### Speicher Physik (Free)
- 8760 hours
- BDEW
- PVGIS
- Battery simulation
- No economy
- No pricing
- No 15-year aggregation

### Speicher Wirtschaft (Pro)
- 15-year aggregation
- Degradation
- Cost modeling
- Scenario simulation
- Extended reporting

### PVShadow
- Geometry
- Roof analysis
- Shading model

### PVNavigator Web (Portal)

Purpose:
- Public entry point (pvnavigator.de)
- Overview of all tools
- Links to:
  - Speicher Physik
  - Speicher Wirtschaft
  - PVShadow
- YouTube link
- Legal pages (Impressum, Datenschutz)

Rules:
- No calculation logic
- No imports from packages/*
- Pure presentation layer
- Acts as routing hub between services

This app must remain lightweight and independent of core logic.
